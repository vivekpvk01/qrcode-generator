# qrcode-generator

Certainly! Below is a documentation template tailored to the project that involves generating a QR code using Python. The template is designed to be professional and concise, suitable for inclusion in a project repository or an "About Me" section as mentioned earlier.

QR Code Generator Documentation
Project Overview
This project is a simple QR code generator implemented in Python. It utilizes the qrcode library to create a QR code that links to a specified URL. The QR code can then be saved as an image file for easy sharing or embedding.

Requirements
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following library:

qrcode
You can install the required library using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install qrcode[pil]
Code Explanation
Here is the main code snippet that generates and saves a QR code linking to a GitHub profile:

python
Copy code
import qrcode as qr

# URL to encode in the QR code
url = "https://github.com/vivekpvk01"

# Generate the QR code
img = qr.make(url)

# Save the generated QR code as an image file
img.save("github.png")
Step-by-Step Breakdown
Import the QRCode Library:

python
Copy code
import qrcode as qr
The qrcode library is imported and aliased as qr for simplicity.

Define the URL:

python
Copy code
url = "https://github.com/vivekpvk01"
The URL that you want to encode into the QR code is specified here. In this case, it's a GitHub profile URL.

Generate the QR Code:

python
Copy code
img = qr.make(url)
The make function generates the QR code for the provided URL.

Save the QR Code as an Image:

python
Copy code
img.save("github.png")
The generated QR code is saved as a PNG image file named github.png.

Usage
To generate a QR code, simply run the Python script. The script will create a QR code that links to the specified URL and save it as an image file in the same directory as the script.

bash
Copy code
python qr_code_generator.py
Output
After running the script, a file named github.png will be created in your working directory. This file contains the QR code, which can be scanned by any QR code reader to open the URL.

Customization
You can easily modify the URL to point to any other link by changing the url variable in the script:

python
Copy code
url = "https://your-custom-url.com"
You can also change the file name when saving the QR code by modifying the img.save() function:

python
Copy code
img.save("custom_name.png")
Conclusion
This project provides a straightforward way to generate QR codes for any URL. It can be easily expanded or integrated into larger projects that require QR code generation.
